    <h2 class="midtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Ragu Bolognese</h4>
    <ul>
        <div class="lists"><li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/4 pound of ground pork</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>Grating of 1 whole nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup of dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes, cut up with their juice</li></div>
    </ul>
    <h4>The béchamel</h4>
    <ul>
        <div class="lists"><li>3 cups of milk</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>4 1/2 tablespoons of flour</li>
        <li>A large pinch of salt</li></div>
    </ul>
    <h4>The noodles</h4>
    <ul>
        <div class="lists"><li>1 cup of all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li></div>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="midtitle">Preparations</h2>
    <h4>Ragu Bolonhese</h4>
    <ol>
        <div class="instructions"><li>In a large saucepan or deep skillet, heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the celery and carrots continue to cook until vegetables begin to get tender, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Break up the ground meat with a spoon or fork as you stir. Cook until all traces of pink are gone from the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and let it simmer gently until it has completely evaporated, stirring occasionally. Add a grating of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and continue to simmer until it is evaporated. Add the tomatoes and their juice, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer. Cook the ragu for at least 3 hours, uncovered. The sauce is done when all the liquid has evaporated and you can see the oil separate from the sauce.</li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and cool until ready to use.</li></div>
    </ol>
    <h4>The Béchamel</h4>
    <ol>
        <div class="instructions"><li>In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the milk.</li>
        <li>In a second saucepan, melt the butter. When it is entirely melted, add the flour. Cook, stirring or whisking constantly for about 2 minutes (the mixture should not darken).</li>
        <li>Slowly start adding the hot milk to the flour mixture, stirring.</li>
        <li>Place the pan over low heat and add the salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens (it should be about the consistency of sour cream).</li></div>
    </ol>
    <p>NOTE: You can keep the béchamel warm by placing it, in a saucepan or heat-resistant bowl, over slowly simmering water. If a skin forms, simply stir it in; it will dissolve.</p>
    <h4>The noodles</h4>
    <ol>
        <div class="instructions"><li>Put a large pot of water (about 4 quarts) over high heat.</li>
        <li>Mound the flour and make a well in the center. Place the eggs in the well and, with a fork, slowly begin to beat them. When the eggs are well beaten, start incorporating the flour little by little until the eggs are no longer runny. Bring the mixture together with your hands (leave a tablespoon or two of the flour off to one side — depending on the size of your eggs and the humidity you may not need all the flour). The dough should be on the dry side and not sticking to your fingers. If it is sticky add the remaining flour little by little.</li>
        <li>Clean the work surface of any crumbs or old flour. Begin to knead the dough: Press on the dough with the palms of your hands and push away from you. Pull it back or fold it and turn the dough clockwise (always turn the dough in the same direction after each push to ensure consistency). Knead for about 8 minutes or until the dough is very smooth and silky.</li></div>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="midtitle">The Assembly</h2>
    <ol>
        <div class="instructions"><li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Butter an ovenproof baking dish (9 inches by 13 inches) and spread a very thin layer of the béchamel on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom with the pasta pieces covering the whole surface of the dish without overlapping.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the béchamel over the pasta, then a very thin layer of the ragu, followed by a sprinkling of grated cheese. Repeat with another layer of pasta, béchamel, Bolognese and parmesan. Keep repeating the layers until you are 6-8 layers thick. Top with a thin spread of béchamel and cheese. You can refrigerate the lasagna at this point for up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>Dot the top with a few pieces of butter and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. There should be a golden crust forming on top. If you do not see a crust forming after 5 minutes turn the oven up to 450 degrees. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li></div>
